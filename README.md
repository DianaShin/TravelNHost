## [TravelNHost live](https://travelnhost.herokuapp.com/#/)

TravelNHost is a full-stack web application inspired by [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com). It is built with Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React/Redux on the frontend. No external libraries were used for styling this application; the look and feel of the website is my own. 

Please see [here](https://github.com/ayoung0131/TravelNHost/wiki) for design documentation. 

## Features 

* Authentication: Secure frontend to backend user authentication using BCrypt.
