## [TravelNHost live](https://travelnhost.herokuapp.com/#/)

TravelNHost is a full-stack web application inspired by [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com). It is built with Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React/Redux on the frontend. No external libraries were used for styling this application; the look and feel of the website is my own. 


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
